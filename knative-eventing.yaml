                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted

                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that
                      30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

                      Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order
                      is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck
                      finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission
                      can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order,
                      then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible
                      for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal
                      (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component
                      responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in
                      a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to
                      order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering
                      changes in the list.

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within

                      (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
